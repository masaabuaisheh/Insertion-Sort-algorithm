# Insertion-Sort-algorithm
This C++ program employs insertion sort to arrange user-provided integers, utilizing vectors for adaptable memory allocation. By iteratively inserting unsorted values amidst already sorted elements, insertion sort efficiently organizes the array. Dynamic memory allocation enables versatility, accommodating arrays of varying sizes.
